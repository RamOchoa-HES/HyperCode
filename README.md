## Team: HyperCode

### Application name : LibStatsHelper

- German Guzman - Product Owner
- Ram Ochoa - Scrum Master
- Tofik Mussa - Developer
- Jeffrey Winning - Developer
- Emmanuel Lingom
- Kristen Rutherford - Developer

#### Our far vision

- Library statistics tracking made simple is our motto. We plan to have a one stop shop for libraries to track their service usage, by their patrons/customers, throughout the year. We plan to have dashboards per the categories of services the library provides. We plan to have visually attractive charts in order to cater to a non-technical audience. Our stakeholders can gauge utilization of existing services and change or introduce new services based on consistent and uniform tracking. Our interface will have data entry and editing functionalities to be used by administrators.

#### Our near vision

- We plan on gathering business requirements, defining wireframes and designing database tables in our first sprint. The first point of order in delivering the product will be completing the landing page and the Access Services Component Page after that.

#### Our stakeholders

- Library staff, Academic institutions, and Library administration personnel.

#### Real stakeholder
- Samantha Cabral, Assistant Director at Regina Library

#### User Persona

- Samantha is a library administrator. She has witnessed the challenge of not having a uniform method or portal to track customer needs and resource utilization. There are currently documents in spreadsheets but it is difficult to gather, analyze, and present to leadership.

#### Initial Backlog Logic

We prioritized our backlog items based on need and dependencies in the following order:

1.  Design wireframes
2.  Create Landing Page
3.  Create Login Page
4.  Access Services Display UI
5.  Access Services Editor UI
6.  ERC Display UI
7.  ERC Editor UI
8.  Research & Instruction Display UI
9.  Research & Instruction Editor UI
10. Marketing & OutReach Display UI
11. Marketing & Outreach Editor UI
12. Inter-Library Loan Display UI
13. Inter-Library Loan Editor UI
14. Technical Services Display UI
15. Technical Services Editor UI
16. Electronic Information Display UI
17. Electronic Information Editor UI

#### Definition of ready for a backlog item

1. Product backlog item has a title.
2. Product backlog item has a brief description (user story opening sentence).
3. Estimated points are clearly displayed in the title after meeting with Dev Team, Product Owner, and Scrum Master and agreed upon by all.
4. Product backlog item has dependencies defined and have a status of completed.
5. There is at least one team member assigned to the backlog item.

#### Definition of Done

1. Primary stakeholder has accepted finished design
2. Code is completed
3. Code was unit tested and approved
4. Code has been deployed to production and  stakeholder was informed

#### Goals for Sprint 1

- Product backlog items are entered and refined.
- Points for backlog items are estimated by the development team
- Development environment setup is completed
- Stories and wireframes are approved by stakeholder
- Any dependencies are identified and prioritized accordingly
- Backlog items are prioritized
- Fully defined stories of priority are picked up by the development team

#### Sprint 1 Forecast

- Total points: 14

Points by story

* Design wireframes - 2
* Access Services Display UI - 5
* Landing Page - 4
* Log In screen - 3

We used the poker game to assign points to our stories. Product owner asked the Development Team members to send via Zoom chat how many points a certain story would take to be completed (The range was 0, 0.5, 1,2,3,5,8,13,20,40,100, and infinity). After Product owner, received all chat messages, the product owner informed the team of the results highlighting the highest point and the lowest point. The product owner either went for a second or more  rounds of estimates or the team member compromised to agreed to a specific number (Ex: lowest was 1 and highest was 20. Team agreed on 5).

#### Sprint 2 Forecast - Yesterday's Weather

- Total points: 17 

Note: compared to our previous sprint, this sprint has an increased capacity due to team members availability. We believe our capacity was at 80% but this sprint our capacity is at 100%

* Access Services Editor UI - 5
* Security & Authentication Back-end - 5
* Advanced Login UI Front End - 5
* Daily Scrum Check - 2

(edited)

###### Tofik Mussa   
Yesterday - worked on finializing the remaining pages in the front and creating entities in the back. Also worked on connecting to DB
12:51
Today - will work on front to back integration and deployment

###### Ram Ochoa   
I have the login page functioning. I still need to connect it to the backend in the next sprint. Next: I will discuss with the team if we want to have users save their info for login in the next sprint. Also, I will look at the rubric to see what I need to submit in the morning. (edited)

###### Emmanuel
Preparing for Sprint Planning
 In the last meeting we stood on the plan that:
-German was completing wireframes and he has made a post on that work in Slack.
-Tofik was to create the landing page.
Ramiro was supposed to create a log in page and he has posted a Template for the log in page
Kristen was to take on the burndown chart
I think Jeff was working on something that I am missing here. Please what was that ?
12:02
German has posted on wireframes in Slack. Let’s revise and see what can be added or done to complete and ship this task.
Tofik has surely delivered on the landing page. How can we examine and accept his work on this aspect?
-Ramiro has posted a Template for the log in page. What to expect so that this can be shipped?
-I do not have news about Kristen on the burndown Chart. Any news?
What was Jeff working on and at what level are we on that aspect?

###### Kristen
Initial analysis on how to create a Burndown Chart

###### German

Worked with Tofik and Jeff on connecting the backend with the front end and preparing environment to go to production.

Coordinate with Samantha to have our Sprint Review.

Worked on burdown Chart


###### Tofik

Worked with Toffik and Jeff on connecting the backend with the front end and preparing environment to go to production.

###### Jeff

Primarily doing pair- or mob-programming with Tofik and German, I did work on all aspects of the Back End of the application. This included adding features and JUnit tests to the Spring Boot application, creating routes for the REST API which will link Front End & Back End, creating a MySQL database, and setting up a server first on DigitalOcean and then on Cloud Foundry.

###### Ram

Yesterday: I have the login page functioning. I still need to connect it to the backend in the next sprint.


###### Emmanuel

I went over our daily stand up and was able to share with the team on a word document our update on the sprint four ceremonies.

###### German

Working on a seeder for the database so we do not have to enter the initial data manually.

###### Ram

Today: I will begin connecting the login page with the database. Impediments: None as of yet.

##### Tofik

Reviewing and making sure deployment to production is good.

##### Jeff

I will work with team to finalize and troubleshoot Front End/Back End integration and deployment of the application to the server

##### Emmanuel

Help the team with insight on sprint review and sprint retrospective during our upcoming meeting

#### Impediments

Issues with initial Production server (Digital ocean). We need to change it to cfapps in order to remove the impediment

#### Daily Scrum Evidence Sprint 2 July 8

#### Tofik Mussa  12:59 AM
Status update - I was able to get authentication working in the back end this evening. I will continue working to integrate with the front end

#### Rogerlingom2015  10:49 AM
Status update, I basically just came here on this thread to see what each and everyone is posting. To check if anyone has expressed any impediments and if the group as a whole is moving forward. Please all let's keep posting what we got going on on this thread as what we have going on is actually part of the work we are doing as a team.

#### Jeffrey Winning  11:14 AM
Update: we have GitLab account and I know how to build the .yml file which defines the stages of testing and deployment. Impediment: the newest builds are not compiling on my home machine. I think it's an issue of intelliJ settings having trouble finding the JDK, so I presume once I figure out which setting is wrong it will be all set. If anyone has thoughts on the subject please share, or if anyone has same issue: when I try to run it is not recognizing the names of any Java classes. As soon as I get past this impediment I should have the project up on GitLab and we can have it run through its first CI pipeline

#### German Guzman  12:07 PM
Status update: working on presentation to stake holders as well and updating documentation needed in our README. I will try to help with CI/CD as able.

#### Ram Ochoa  3:09 PM
Update: I got a BDD test to run by inserting a welcome message in an h1 tag on the landing page using protractor e2e. This is a start. I will work on making both the TDD and this BDD test more targeted today. In the mean time the CD should be able to be implemented using these tests and the backend tests Tofik made.
