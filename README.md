#### Our far vision

- Library statistics tracking made simple is our moto. We plan to have a one stop shop for libraries to tailor their services to the needs of their users. We plan to have dashboards per the categories of services the library provides. We plan to have visually attractive charts in order to cater to a non-technical audience. Our stakeholders can gauge customer satisfaction and introduce new services based on consistent feedback. Our interface will have data entry and editing functionalities to be used by administrators.

#### Our near vision

- We plan on gathering business requirements, defining wireframes and designing database tables in our first sprint. We plan on tackling the landing page and the Access Services Component Page after that.

#### Our stakeholders

- Library staff, Academic institutions, and Library administration personnel.

#### Real stakeholder
- Samantha Cabral, Assistant Director at Regina Library

#### User Persona

- Samantha is a library administrator. She has witnessed the challenge of having a portal to track customer needs and resource utilization. There are currently documents in spreadsheets but it is difficult to gather, analyze, and present to leadership.
