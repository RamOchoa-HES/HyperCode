## Team: HyperCode

### Application name : LibStatsHelper

- German Guzman - Product Owner
- Ram Ochoa - Scrum Master
- Tofik Mussa - Developer
- Jeffrey Winning - Developer
- Emmanuel Lingom
- Kristen Rutherford - Developer

#### Our far vision

- Library statistics tracking made simple is our motto. We plan to have a one stop shop for libraries to track their service usage, by their patrons/customers, throughout the year. We plan to have dashboards per the categories of services the library provides. We plan to have visually attractive charts in order to cater to a non-technical audience. Our stakeholders can gauge utilization of existing services and change or introduce new services based on consistent and uniform tracking. Our interface will have data entry and editing functionalities to be used by administrators.

#### Our near vision

- We plan on gathering business requirements, defining wireframes and designing database tables in our first sprint. The first point of order in delivering the product will be completing the landing page and the Access Services Component Page after that.

#### Our stakeholders

- Library staff, Academic institutions, and Library administration personnel.

#### Real stakeholder
- Samantha Cabral, Assistant Director at Regina Library

#### User Persona

- Samantha is a library administrator. She has witnessed the challenge of not having a uniform method or portal to track customer needs and resource utilization. There are currently documents in spreadsheets but it is difficult to gather, analyze, and present to leadership.

#### Initial Backlog Logic

We prioritized our backlog items based on need and dependencies in the following order:

1.  Design wireframes
2.  Create Landing Page
3.  Create Login Page
4.  Access Services Display UI
5.  Access Services Editor UI
6.  ERC Display UI
7.  ERC Editor UI
8.  Research & Instruction Display UI
9.  Research & Instruction Editor UI
10. Marketing & OutReach Display UI
11. Marketing & Outreach Editor UI
12. Inter-Library Loan Display UI
13. Inter-Library Loan Editor UI
14. Technical Services Display UI
15. Technical Services Editor UI
16. Electronic Information Display UI
17. Electronic Information Editor UI

#### Definition of ready for a backlog item

1. Product backlog item has a title.
2. Product backlog item has a brief description (user story opening sentence).
3. Estimated points are clearly displayed in the title after meeting with Dev Team, Product Owner, and Scrum Master and agreed upon by all.
4. Product backlog item has dependencies defined and have a status of completed.
5. There is at least one team member assigned to the backlog item.

#### Definition of Done

1. Primary stakeholder has accepted finished design
2. Code is completed
3. Code was unit tested and approved
4. Code has been deployed to production and  stakeholder was informed

#### Goals for Sprint 1

- Product backlog items are entered and refined.
- Points for backlog items are estimated by the development team
- Development environment setup is completed
- Stories and wireframes are approved by stakeholder
- Any dependencies are identified and prioritized accordingly
- Backlog items are prioritized
- Fully defined stories of priority are picked up by the development team

#### Sprint 1 Forecast

- Total points: 14

Points by story

* Design wireframes - 2
* Access Services Display UI - 5
* Landing Page - 4
* Log In screen - 3

We used the poker game to assign points to our stories. Product owner asked the Development Team members to send via Zoom chat how many points a certain story would take to be completed (The range was 0, 0.5, 1,2,3,5,8,13,20,40,100, and infinity). After Product owner, received all chat messages, the product owner informed the team of the results highlighting the highest point and the lowest point. The product owner either went for a second or more  rounds of estimates or the team member compromised to agreed to a specific number (Ex: lowest was 1 and highest was 20. Team agreed on 5).

###### Ram Ochoa   
I have the login page functioning. I still need to connect it to the backend in the next sprint. Next: I will discuss with the team if we want to have users save their info for login in the next sprint. Also, I will look at the rubric to see what I need to submit in the morning. (edited)

###### Emmanuel
Preparing for Sprint Planning
 In the last meeting we stood on the plan that:
-German was completing wireframes and he has made a post on that work in Slack.
-Tofik was to create the landing page.
Ramiro was supposed to create a log in page and he has posted a Template for the log in page
Kristen was to take on the burndown chart
I think Jeff was working on something that I am missing here. Please what was that ?
12:02
German has posted on wireframes in Slack. Let’s revise and see what can be added or done to complete and ship this task.
Tofik has surely delivered on the landing page. How can we examine and accept his work on this aspect?
-Ramiro has posted a Template for the log in page. What to expect so that this can be shipped?
-I do not have news about Kristen on the burndown Chart. Any news?
What was Jeff working on and at what level are we on that aspect?
